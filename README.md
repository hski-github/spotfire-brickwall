# Spotfire Kanban Board Visualisation

Spotfire mods visualisation for Kanban board in Spotfire.


## How to get started (with development server)
All source code for the mod example can be found in the `src` folder. 
These instructions assume that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) installed.

- Open a terminal at the location of this example.
- Run `npm install`. This will install necessary tools. Run this command only the first time you are building the mod and skip this step for any subsequent builds.
- Run `npm run server`. This will start a development server.
- Start editing, for example `src/main.js`.
- In Spotfire, follow the steps of creating a new mod and connecting to the development server.
